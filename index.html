            <p>"If I had to pick who I think is just the most talented, it would probably be Ken Silverman, the guy that
                did the BUILD engine. He does engines and tools. He's great as an editor. He writes all the code for
                everything, and he's just extremely talented. I think it was 3D Realms' worst decisions not to coddle
                him, or whatever it took, to keep him on board. I think if he was still working directly for 3D Realms,
                they would have a Quake-type game shipped by now, just because he's extraordinarily good."</p>
