# Tribute page

## Description

I have completed this project properly a couple months ago. As subject, I've chosen [Ken Silverman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Silverman), one of my childhood programming heroes.
He was one of those personalities that got me interested in programming many years ago, before I went in a different direction (but that's another story), so it felt appropriate to dedicate to him to celebrate this new "start".

Building this tribute page was a good starter exercise in choosing an appropriate color palette and fonts that would fit the topic. I tried to keep the number of colors and fonts as low as possible to avoid causing confusion to the user/reader, while still making the page look nice. 

I thought that including only one main picture was not enough, and decided to try and use JavaScript to create a sort of gallery for the user to navigate through. 
The user can change pictures by clicking on arrow-images that act as buttons. These move leftwards or rightwards through an array of pictures paths and set the page picture to that path. If the user has reached the end of the array, it will just restart from the opposite side, thus avoiding errors. 

Although this is a very basic implementation, I had a lot of fun in adding it and it helped me realise how endless the possibilities are when adding JavaScript to a page for interactivity. 

I'm very much looking forward to improving my skills and see what other things I or the team I'm working with can come up with!
